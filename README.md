Cyans Simple Factions

Info
Cyans Simple Factions is a faction command that has the bare bone (right now) to do everything a faction server owner would need land claiming, war, peace, simple config, etc. 
Raiding works by allowing TNT to break obsidian but pickaxes can not inside ONLY inside faction claimed chunks, this allows for strategy on how to get into someones base and puts more time on griefing and raiding in general.
During war factions can not deposit/withdraw money from there bank to create warps or buy items, this makes factions have to think about diplomacy and strategy in war.
